# NodeJs-Typescript-Template for npm packet

A sample setup of a Typescript based API which uses Exegesis to work with the OpenAPI spec v3.

I made this because on the exegesis repo there is a sample setup however there is only a javascript version available. 

# Usage
Clone the repo and cd into the working directory :

```
git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Gordon/exegesis-typescript-example.git 

```

Then install the dependancies with `npm install`. Yarn is okay too!

Lastly run the API using :  

```
npm run dev
```

Please submit an issue if you have any problems, head over to the [Exegesis Repo](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis) for other examples.
